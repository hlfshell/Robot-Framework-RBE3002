TurretClass.py

Author: Keith Chester

Turrets are objects comprised of infrared
sensors and servos (or steppers). They are
children of both actuator and sensor class.

The additional function of a turret class is
its pan() function, which will create and return
a list of polar coordinate readings (angle, magnitude)
of what the turret sees in front of it.

This class was created for a more abstracted and
easily organized view of a turret/sensor platform.
